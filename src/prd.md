### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations guide attention to suggestions and confirmations
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Priority on correction highlights, secondary on state changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, functional animations that don't distract from typing flow

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for suggestions, badges for confidence levels, buttons for actions
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, accessibility-focused touch targets
- **Component States**: Clear hover, focus, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements
